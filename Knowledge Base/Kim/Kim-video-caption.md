00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:10.000
Okay, here are the top sales questions I
get. One of the first things people

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:17.119
always say is, "I'm terrible at sales.
How do I make sales less icky?" And

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:21.039
typically sales feels icky and yucky.
When you don't know what to say, when

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:27.119
you're not confident in your message,
when you don't know how to explain the

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:32.880
actual solution you provide. Most people
get really bogged down in the details

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:40.239
and the details of all of their features
and benefits instead of the solution.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:44.960
Most people are looking for a solution.
If you're talking to somebody and you're

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:51.280
listening and you're really
understanding their needs, then you

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:55.840
should never have to even ask for the
sale if it's done right. You should

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:00.079
talking. You should be able to talk to
somebody. You should be able to analyze

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:07.760
what their problem is. And then you
should be able to be the solution. So

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:13.760
most of us are terrible at sales because
we don't know how to articulate what it

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:18.000
is that we do. You should be able to
tell somebody what you do in one

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:22.640
sentence, in 10 seconds, in 15 seconds,
but you should be able to tell them

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:28.960
exactly what you do so people have a
really clear per they have a really

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:34.640
clear understanding. And everything that
you do starts with the message. It's

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:40.000
about talking to the right person. So
knowing your target audience and then

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:46.479
being the solution to whatever they
need. this isn't the time to talk all

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:52.000
features, benefits, pricing. Um, and so
those are some tips. Really, it comes

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:56.159
with confidence in your offer,
confidence in knowing what you do,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:02.560
confidence in being able to articulate
what you do. Okay, so next question.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:07.040
What are the top negotiating taxes to
close a sale? And this is such an

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:12.080
interesting one because I think part of
the reason why sales sounds icky is

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:17.040
because people are negotiating. Nobody
wants to throw out the first number. And

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:22.640
you really shouldn't have to negotiate.
You should be confident in your price.

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:28.959
The reason why we all feel sales is icky
is because we have that vision in our

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:34.400
minds of car salesman throwing a number
down, passing it across the table. And

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.440
when you're doing sales, you want it to
be personal. You want to build

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:44.640
relationships because people buy from
people they know, like, and trust. And

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:52.800
so for me and what I recommend for
people is the number one thing you can

00:02:47.200 --> 00:03:00.480
do is to be silent, to stop talking, to
listen more, and to really be able to

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:05.599
shut up after you say the price and not
have to justify. So if your offer is

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:10.879
$500,
you've already talked about the results

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:15.599
that you know somebody's going to get.
they won't really be caring that much

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:23.440
about the price. Where people make
mistakes is they start to oversell,

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:29.360
start to defend the price, start to feel
bad about it. So before you even get to

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:34.640
the price, you want to stack the value.
You want to remind them what it's going

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:40.720
to cost them if they don't move forward.
Is it going to be time? Is it going to

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:48.080
be energy? Is it going to be um you know
stress? Like you want to be able to say

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:54.159
that before they even get to it, before
you're even closing, they're already

00:03:51.040 --> 00:04:00.480
buying in. You're already getting little
yeses along the way and you're setting

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:07.840
the stage. So all along the sales
process, you're saying things like,

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:14.959
"Here's what we could do. Here's what I
recommend. This is how I see us being

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:22.560
able to work together. So along the way,
you're already getting them to buy in.

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:28.000
If they're asking questions, then
they're already sold. So that's when you

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:32.800
don't want to keep pitching.
So let's talk about when it's best to

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:39.360
say no to a client. To me, this is
really easy. Say no if they don't align

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:43.680
with your core values. Say no if the
client drains you. If there's no

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:50.639
boundaries. If they're talking for about
something that's outside your lane. If

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:56.080
they're not your ideal client. Have an
idea in your mind of what are the top 10

00:04:53.360 --> 00:05:04.000
qualities that you want in a client. Get
really specific. And then we like to say

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:10.479
say no to the good so you can say yes to
the great. You know I always like to say

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:15.520
this might not be the right fit for you
but I can always point you in the wrong

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:20.880
right direction or this might be the
right not the right time. Um take

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:26.560
yourself out of it. This isn't personal.
And just remember that your job is to

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:29.919
give somebody solutions and to make them
feel like this is the best decision

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:33.600
they're going to make. They're going to
get more time back. They're going to

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:37.919
save money. They're going to get ROI.
Whatever the results are, or that's

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:43.600
going to be you provide a service and
they feel good, they're going to have

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:48.960
transformation. Sell the results. But
say no to a client that is asking you

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:54.639
for too much. And you've probably heard
this, you know, that it's it takes the

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:58.560
same amount of work to to do the job for
somebody who's paying 500 or somebody

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:02.800
who's paying a,000. And typically the
ones who are asking for a better price,

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:10.960
they're the ones that come with lots of
problems. So hold true to your price.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:16.800
Um, which leads into
when and if you should get, you know,

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:23.120
give a client discount. Um, you know, a
lot of it depends on your business

00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:28.560
model. Think of it as a strategic tool,
right? You're only going to offer

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:35.280
something if they're getting value back,
right? It could be um a longer

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:41.039
commitment. It could be more volume. I
typically am not a fan of cutting the

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:46.479
price. I It's not really a strategy.
It's definitely more insecurity.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:52.639
Um you know if someone says can you do
better you can say I can adjust this

00:06:49.520 --> 00:07:01.280
adjust the scope of work if we need to.
Um so I don't like to negotiate on price

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:07.120
you know people still are like you know
can I pick your brain? Yes you can pick

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:14.880
my brain for $200. Like your time is
valuable. So really know that price

00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:20.960
integrity, it builds trust. When you
cave too soon, it teach it's teaching

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:28.000
people um that waiting gets them a deal.
When you cave, it's devaluing you and

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:35.120
your expertise. And so really think
about setting your prices. And I like

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:40.400
the idea of having multiple packages so
that you have a mid tier, a a low tier,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:45.280
a mid tier, and an entry level. I mean,
and a and a a low tier, a mid tier, and

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:48.800
a high tier. So, if they can't afford
your high tier, you can recommend the

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:55.360
mid tier. If they can't afford the mid
tier, you can recommend the low tier.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:08:01.759
So, instead of having discounts, give
options.

00:07:58.319 --> 00:08:08.000
So people always get this wrong. They
never know when to stop selling, you

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:13.199
know, and this is the key. And once you
understand this, this is everything. You

00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:17.039
know, when you're able to close with a
simple sentence that's like, okay,

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:22.960
here's what I recommend we do next. We
start tomorrow. We do this. We do that.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:29.360
Does that work? Typically,
you shall you will know all the buying

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:35.680
triggers as you're working with somebody
as they're shaking their head. You know,

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:41.680
you want to explain the value, the next
step, you know, decision date. You are

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:45.600
not here to chase. You can say things
like, I'm only taking a certain amount

00:08:43.279 --> 00:08:50.480
of clients this month. I need to know.
You can give them a deadline. But one of

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:55.360
the things that you want to do in the
beginning is just ask a lot of

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:59.519
questions. What are you looking for? You
know, do you have the budget for this?

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:04.560
If we're the right fit, when do you want
to start? Are you in, you know, urgent

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:11.200
mode or is this a project for next year?
But ask the right questions. And then if

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:17.120
you're going to quote somebody um and
send something in an email, I really

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:22.560
recommend that before you do that, you
set up a followup. I always like to what

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:28.800
I call bam fam, book a meeting from a
meeting and set up a followup to go over

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:32.640
any proposal with them, you know,
because a lot of times what happens is

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:38.640
they just look at the number and they
don't see the value. And you want to be

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:43.839
able to walk somebody through
all the details. You want to be able to,

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:49.839
you know, it's your chance to one more
time showcase your expertise and why

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:54.959
they need something, why you're the
right fit. Too many times I've seen

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:59.200
somebody send a quote and then tell them
the price and then you negotiate against

00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:07.040
yourself and you give them a lower
price. Most of the time it's not always

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:13.600
about price. And before you discount,
before you change the price, you want to

00:10:11.279 --> 00:10:19.839
know if that's the real objection
because you can say things like, "Well,

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:26.399
if it was $500, would you sign today or
is it really just the $1,000 that's

00:10:22.399 --> 00:10:31.680
holding you back?" Ask for specifics.
Um, and that's why I like to set up a

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:36.480
date when you're sending the quote or
set a follow-up time when you're doing

00:10:33.519 --> 00:10:44.240
that. And you can say the proposal is
valid through X amount of date. You

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:49.920
know, um, I really encourage you not to
discount before you know if that's the

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:53.839
issue.
Now, one of the things people ask all

00:10:52.240 --> 00:11:00.560
the time is, "What's the connection
between sales and marketing?" And to me,

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:05.040
these two things have to go together. So
many times, somebody's telling me, "Oh,

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:09.360
I'm doing a brand video. Oh, I put up my
website." And the first thing I always

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:13.680
ask them is, "Did you have a sales
consultant?" Or, "Do you have a sales

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:17.920
strategy? Do you know what the messaging
is?" Because there's no sense spending

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:23.440
tens of thousands of dollars on a
website if you haven't done the right

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:29.120
work behind the scenes and really
understand what the messaging is, who

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:32.880
your audience is, what your systems are.
Because sales and marketing, they go

00:11:31.279 --> 00:11:39.839
together. They're like lungs and
heartbeat. The marketing is to get them

00:11:36.399 --> 00:11:45.760
curious and the sales is to get them to
a commitment. And so the two things

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:51.680
together, they have to speak the same
language. Where marketing tells the

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:56.640
story, sales proves it's true. And when
they work together, your audience

00:11:53.839 --> 00:12:01.519
doesn't just know who you are. They
trust you. Everything's in alignment.

00:11:59.279 --> 00:12:07.440
And this connection needs to happen on
your website, on your social media, on

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:15.440
your blogs. Everything that you do,
there has to be a connection, an

00:12:10.079 --> 00:12:20.160
intention behind the scenes so that the
sales and marketing match up. Because

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:23.600
you could say the greatest thing, but if
you have ugly pictures and people don't

00:12:22.079 --> 00:12:28.720
get your product, they're never going to
buy. And at the same point, you could

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:35.279
have the prettiest pictures and the most
exciting marketing campaign, but if the

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:40.720
sales wording and the sales messaging
and the sales funnel don't match up,

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:47.519
then you're going to be dead in the
water. All of those things need to

00:12:44.399 --> 00:12:51.320
really be consistent
across the board.

00:13:00.079 --> 00:13:10.560
Okay, other questions that I get asked
is how do you build a proper salesunnel?

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:16.079
So, for those of you who don't know what
a salesunnel is and why you need it, a

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:22.959
salesunnel is a really clear path that
goes from who you are to what you do to

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:27.440
where do I sign? Most people over
complicate this. The first step is

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:31.839
awareness. Get the intention of
somebody. Maybe you're just doing this

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:36.800
on social media. You're posting valuable
content. Maybe you have a newsletter.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:43.360
Maybe you're doing blogs. Maybe you have
some free product. Um, this is real

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:47.279
content that solves micro problems. So,
it doesn't it's not telling them the

00:13:45.279 --> 00:13:51.440
who, what, where, and the how. It's
telling them here's a problem and here's

00:13:49.519 --> 00:13:57.120
a solution I can help you with. So,
that's awareness. Then there's interest.

00:13:54.079 --> 00:14:02.480
What? Give them something to opt into.
Give them a freebie, a quiz, a workshop,

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:06.240
a diagnostic diagnostic.
They're interested in they've been aware

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:11.839
of what you're doing. Now they're a
little bit more curious. So they need

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:17.120
something that again is going to help
build that you're the authority. And

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:23.279
then perhaps there's an evaluation and
that's testimonials, case studies,

00:14:20.079 --> 00:14:26.959
before and afters, results so that
people first are looking at awareness,

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:32.880
then they're interested and then they
need to like have sort of that proof

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:37.199
like show me that this works. And then
there's the decision. And then it's

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:41.839
making it easy for people to buy, giving
clear pricing, transparent process, easy

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:47.279
checkout, booking link, whatever that
looks like. And then there's retention.

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:53.920
Most people forget about this. And
remember, 80% of your business should

00:14:50.399 --> 00:14:59.199
come from 20% of your clients. So, you
want a retention plan.

00:14:56.560 --> 00:15:04.560
You don't need a 100 steps. You don't
need any of um that. What you really

00:15:01.839 --> 00:15:10.399
need is a simple funnel. And then behind
the scenes, when somebody does buy your

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:16.560
product, you need a nurture campaign.
You need to keep people in the loop.

00:15:13.199 --> 00:15:24.399
That's all part of the retention program
so that you can really keep those

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:30.959
clients. And if you do this piece right,
your clients become your raving fans and

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:37.440
they in essence become your sales team.
So, those are some of the top things

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:44.639
that I get asked. And I want to also
share that most business owners and

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:49.360
founders, they're not delegating. Sales
is something that is a good thing to

00:15:46.959 --> 00:15:56.720
delegate. Um, and for a lot of people,
they're not doing that. Control feels

00:15:52.320 --> 00:16:00.320
safer. Most leaders or founders and
entrepreneurs, they hang on too tight

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:05.040
because they think that they're going to
be able to do it better or no one will

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:09.600
do it as well. Um, which might or might
not be true. But the problem is that

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:15.199
keeps you in sort of the weeds of
things, not leading. Um, so if you want

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:22.000
growth, you have to think progress, not
perfection. You have to start focusing

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:27.360
on the outcomes, not just the activity.
And so really think about who can you

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:37.920
delegate. You want to do the things you
do best and delegate your weaknesses.

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:44.800
Okay. So um here's a couple more things
that people tend to struggle with when

00:16:42.959 --> 00:16:51.839
they're thinking about sales. Some
people are just naturally gifted, but

00:16:47.199 --> 00:16:57.680
most are not. Most sales are a learned
skill set. Um, it is a skill. It's not a

00:16:55.120 --> 00:17:02.800
personality trait. You can learn it in
the same way you learn how to drive,

00:17:00.399 --> 00:17:07.120
ride a bike, manage a team. You know,
the people who win sales, they're not

00:17:05.039 --> 00:17:12.720
the loudest. They're the most
consistent. They're focusing less on

00:17:10.319 --> 00:17:18.880
performing, meaning they're focusing
more on understanding the process, the

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:26.400
customer. they're genuinely curious to
somebody's problem. And as soon as you

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:31.679
start again listening more and being the
solution, you know, people are always

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:36.240
like, "Well, I don't want to sell." And
then other people are like, "Well, you

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:41.120
should share." And I really think it
isn't selling, it isn't sharing, it's

00:17:38.559 --> 00:17:45.600
being the solution.
So for a lot of people, the hardest part

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:51.280
about sales is talking about money. Um,
so many times people don't know what ask

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:56.880
to ask for their services. Um, and
again, reframe it. You're not asking for

00:17:54.240 --> 00:18:00.880
money. You're offering an outcome.
Because the truth is, if somebody said,

00:17:59.039 --> 00:18:05.520
"Hey, Kim, here's a magic pill. You're
going to lose 100 pounds overnight. I

00:18:02.559 --> 00:18:10.080
wouldn't care what it cost." Right? So,
it's typically not money. It's people

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:16.960
are scared that they won't get the
results. Your job is to speak with

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:24.480
confidence, to share stories, to talk
about the results and really trade

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:29.360
transformation for an actual number. So
when you believe in what you're selling,

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:33.600
the money conversation, it just becomes
neutral. Um, you know, practice saying

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:39.520
your price out loud. You know, the
investment's 3500 and then stop talking,

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:44.960
right? Um, there's no filter, there's no
justification. Confidence isn't just

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:51.039
feeling, you know,
overcoming being nervous. It's about

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:57.200
acting certain even where you are. And
again, it just goes back to put the

00:18:53.440 --> 00:19:02.160
price out there, stop talking. Um, a lot
of times people are just so afraid of

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:06.799
no. And again, if this is something you
can change your mindset and think, I

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:12.559
can't wait to get a no because it's
going to get me closer to the yes. No

00:19:09.679 --> 00:19:17.200
isn't a rejection. Think of it as
information. If somebody's not ready,

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:21.360
they're not ready. Um they're not clear.
They're not convinced. Your job isn't to

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:26.640
take it personally. It's to get to the
root cause and find why. And asking

00:19:23.919 --> 00:19:32.799
like, well, what would need to happen in
order for you to move forward? What's

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:39.280
holding you back? Asking the questions
like, is this a timing thing? you know,

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:46.640
based on what you told me, these were
the outcomes you wanted. So, you want to

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:53.280
stay in control of this and be okay. If
it's not now, then let's talk again and

00:19:50.799 --> 00:19:57.440
revisit it in 6 months and book a
meeting from the meeting. Most people

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:02.240
really are like, I don't like being
pushy. And what cracks me up is, you

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:06.720
know, the pushy people, they don't even
know that they're pushy. So, if you're

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:11.679
already worried about being pushy, you
are not. Because good sales people, they

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:17.760
don't push. They guide. They're taking
you on like a storytelling journey,

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:24.080
being that solution. They're walking
through the decisions with you and

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:30.320
they're really listening. So again, if
you feel like you're being pushy, then

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:38.240
slow down, ask more questions, and
really let the customer start to ask you

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:42.720
like, "Well, what do I need to do next?"
When you get to that point and they're

00:20:40.559 --> 00:20:47.840
asking you what you need to do next,
that's when you win.

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:53.360
So, how do I sell when I'm scared and
they think I'm too expensive?

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:58.159
So, if you go into a call assuming they
can't afford it and you're already

00:20:55.840 --> 00:21:01.840
thinking about that, then that's exactly
what's going to happen. Because I'm

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:06.720
telling you, and I've said this again,
and I'll be a broken record because

00:21:03.919 --> 00:21:13.039
repetition lends emphasis. Price isn't
the problem. Clarity is. You have to be

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:18.159
very specific about the results you
deliver. The clearer you are on the

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:25.360
outcome, the smaller the price feels.
Remember, people don't buy cheap, they

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:33.280
buy certain. And think about when people
feel certain, they will find a way. So,

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:37.840
what if you don't know what to say? So,
a lot of times this is typically because

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:41.919
you're just saying too much. You're
telling them all about the product, all

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:48.000
about your services, all about the
benefits, all about the features. Sales

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:55.039
is not about having the perfect script.
It's about asking smart questions. So if

00:21:50.559 --> 00:22:01.840
you are talking too much, I want you to
think about what question can I ask? And

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:06.960
even think about answering a question
with a question. So if somebody's asking

00:22:04.559 --> 00:22:12.240
you about something, you can say, why is
that important to me? Is that something

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:17.760
that's happening in your organization
that you want help with? So

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:22.960
understanding what's the biggest problem
your customer is trying to solve, what

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:28.880
happens if it doesn't get fixed, what
would solving change it for you, those

00:22:25.679 --> 00:22:34.400
are going to be your keys to everything,
and what would need to happen for you to

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:42.679
say yes. Because when you ask that
question, then you will have a clear

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:42.679
path to the sale.

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:58.960
Um, so the other thing people ask is
they hate following up. That makes them

00:22:56.559 --> 00:23:04.320
feel desperate. And I'm here to tell you
the fortune is in the followup. But you

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:10.799
don't want to say like, "Hey, checking
in. Hey, have you had a chance to look

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:14.960
at my email?" You really don't want to
beg for followup. It's leadership.

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:20.480
You're not chasing people. You're
helping them make a decision. Somebody

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:25.840
who is confident. They're not
apologizing like, "Hey, I don't want to

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:29.919
bug you." It's more, "I know how easy it
is for things to fall through the

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:35.600
cracks. Are we still a go on this?"
Simple, direct, confident. I know the

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:41.760
last time that we talked, you wanted to
look at your budget. Have you reviewed

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:47.760
that? and are you ready to move forward?
You know, you want to

00:23:44.559 --> 00:23:51.039
always be the one setting the stage. You
know, you can say things like, "The last

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:56.159
time we talked, you said this was your
biggest problem. Is it still something

00:23:53.280 --> 00:24:02.400
that's a priority for you?" But and you
also, and the you know, the easiest way

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:07.520
to get over feeling desperate is again
to always set a follow-up before you

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:13.120
hang up. Um, if you have a calendar
link, book it while you're on there. But

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:18.480
really, following up shouldn't feel like
a pest. And before you get off a call,

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:23.440
you can also say, "I'm going to call you
next week. Will you be able to make a

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:27.600
decision by then? You are always
leading."

00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:33.760
So, a lot of times people get nervous
every time they pitch. You know, I like

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:38.960
to say, you know, nerves is just energy.
you have the same feelings as anxiety

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:46.240
and excitement. They're actually one in
the same when you are really prepared

00:24:43.039 --> 00:24:54.559
when you know your business inside and
out. Again, you're not pitching, you're

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:59.200
providing a solution. It's all about the
right words, the right messaging,

00:24:56.960 --> 00:25:04.400
knowing your audience pain points. When
you know all that, it's not a pitch. It

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:10.400
should be a conversation with somebody,
a connection. And so if it starts to

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:15.840
feel like a poor performance, you know
that you're in the wrong because you

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:22.640
want it to be a conversation.
So the I'm afraid to say the wrong thing

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:30.000
and lose the sale. So there is that
cliche, you can't say the wrong thing to

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:35.039
the right person, you know, and if
you're saying something that's wrong,

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:39.520
they're not the right person. You know,
if you think of things that you forget

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:42.320
to say, you can say one of the thing,
you know, we just got off the call and

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:47.200
one of the things that I meant to tell
you that I think is important for your

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:53.279
business, everything should always be
about what's in it for them. You know,

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:57.440
sales is practice. Sales is a skill to
learn. You're not always going to say

00:25:55.039 --> 00:26:02.320
the right thing. And most of the times,
it's not even going to matter. You don't

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:08.720
have to say the right thing all the
time. You want to be natural. You want

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:14.320
to be relaxed. You want to have their
best intentions at heart. And again, if

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:21.600
you're thinking about what's in it for
them and you're focused on them, you

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:28.400
can't say the wrong thing. So, just a
couple quick things when it comes to,

00:26:25.919 --> 00:26:32.480
you know, building confidence in sales.
Um, number one, know your numbers.

00:26:30.559 --> 00:26:37.279
Confidence comes from data. Track
conversions, close rates, the average

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:42.480
deal size. When you start to see
progress, confidence follows. know that,

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:46.880
you know, you might need to talk to 10
people to close one deal. That means

00:26:44.799 --> 00:26:51.360
nine nos you're not going to care about
because, you know, the 10th one's

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:57.039
coming. A lot of people, they hate this.
They hate role playing out loud. Um, but

00:26:54.480 --> 00:27:01.520
there is something about saying it out
loud when you're not just thinking it.

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:06.799
The words sound different in your head.
Get your reps in. The more you practice,

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:12.640
the smoother it feels. Um, and again,
we've talked about this, but reframe

00:27:09.039 --> 00:27:17.039
sales as service. You're not selling.
You're showing people how to make smart

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:25.520
decisions. Take the pressure off
yourself. Um, don't be attached to the

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:31.520
outcome. Be attached to the activity.
And really get obsessed with discovery.

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:39.360
This is you have two ears and one mouth
for a reason. Listen more. Ask better

00:27:35.039 --> 00:27:44.720
questions. You will sell less and close
more when you ask better questions. You

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:52.480
won't feel like you're selling.
Curiosity is the number one thing you

00:27:48.159 --> 00:27:57.440
can do to get sales. Before you start
pitching your services, make sure you

00:27:55.200 --> 00:28:03.200
know what you need. One of the biggest
mistakes I think I see people make is

00:28:00.559 --> 00:28:07.120
they oversell on things that a customer
doesn't need. Maybe if you're a

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:11.360
marketing company and somebody just
needs a website, just talk about the

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:16.799
website. Don't talk about social media.
Don't talk about um all the other, you

00:28:14.559 --> 00:28:23.679
know, videos or whatever. Talk about the
website. Stop selling everything. Sell

00:28:19.919 --> 00:28:29.360
the one solution that they need. And you
can do that when you get obsessed with

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:34.960
discovery. Um, we already talked about
get it, get, you know, detach from the

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:39.520
outcome. You're, you know, the only,
your only job is to bring clarity to the

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:44.480
conversation. Your job is to include
them in the conversation. You know, I do

00:28:42.399 --> 00:28:48.480
like to say it's, it's what you hear
waiters and waitresses say all the time

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:52.880
when they come to you at their table and
say, "Hey, here's what the specials are.

00:28:50.559 --> 00:28:57.520
Here's what I recommend. How many times
do you get what the waiter recommends?

00:28:55.600 --> 00:29:04.320
That is the most powerful thing you can
say is here's what I recommend. Um, make

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:07.520
sure that your offer is simple. If you
can't explain what you sell in one

00:29:06.159 --> 00:29:14.480
sentence, you're never going to have
sales confidence. Clarity sales

00:29:10.559 --> 00:29:20.559
confusion uh gets a no almost every
single time. We talked about mastering

00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:26.799
your silence. The minute you say the
price, do not feel that with just more

00:29:25.279 --> 00:29:33.520
explanation.
Don't feel that the confidence is quiet.

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:39.679
And remember, they got on a call with
you. They're meeting with you. They want

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:46.320
something that you have. They see you as
a solution. Step into that energy like

00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:51.520
knowing that, hey, they need something
from me. So, really think about that.

00:29:49.279 --> 00:29:56.640
Um, yes, you probably need them, too,
but you're not lucky that they're on the

00:29:54.240 --> 00:30:01.960
call. They're lucky you're on the call
because you have a solution for them.

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:21.840
So, when it comes to
pricing and profit, we get asked a lot

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:25.600
of time, how do I know what to charge?
And you don't base your price based on

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:31.120
what you feels are comfortable. You
based your price on the results you

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:37.200
deliver. So, if you're solving a $10,000
problem, charging $1,500 doesn't make

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:42.880
sense. Um, so start with the outcome.
What's the measurable transformation?

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:46.799
What's it worth? That's your anchor. and
then decide what kind of business you

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:53.039
want, high volume or high value and
price accordingly. You know, compare

00:30:49.919 --> 00:30:59.120
what other um some of your competitors
are doing. Look at the offers they have

00:30:56.720 --> 00:31:04.799
and then really lean into what are your
strengths, what would you charge by the

00:31:01.039 --> 00:31:10.240
hour, what does it cost you your time,
what does it cost you to make. You have

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:17.120
to really backend all of that and really
think about what do you want to make.

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:22.480
Um, some of you might charge by the hour
and that is an absolutely okay thing to

00:31:20.559 --> 00:31:26.799
do, but really think about if you're
charging by the hour, you're really

00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:32.720
trading time for money and ultimately
there's only so many hours in the way in

00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:36.320
the day. So I would think try to think
about what are some other products and

00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:43.760
services that could bring bring me a
passive income whether it's digital

00:31:39.039 --> 00:31:49.679
courses whether you're you know having
different packages that are like done in

00:31:46.399 --> 00:31:54.640
seven days or 3 week sprint you know so
that you're again you're selling the

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:59.840
result not your time
um you know again people get worried

00:31:57.279 --> 00:32:05.200
about the price it's just confidence
it's not a pricing problem. Say your

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:11.679
price out loud. You know, think about
what you have paid a ton of for for you

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:16.559
know, a product or service and think
about why you paid for that. Um, you

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:22.960
know, whether you should raise your
prices. I think it just depends on you

00:32:19.519 --> 00:32:27.679
know when the demand increases, when
results improve, when you're feeling

00:32:25.039 --> 00:32:32.159
confident. I mean, typically it just
depends on what people value. Sometimes

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:37.120
people just value the more expensive,
the higher price. Who is your client? It

00:32:35.279 --> 00:32:44.320
all comes down to who are you trying to
serve? What are their pain points? And

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:50.159
how you can be the solution. Um, most of
the time, you know, people are used to

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:55.440
people raising prices and when they know
and like and trust you, that's going to

00:32:52.559 --> 00:32:58.440
be just fine.
Um

00:33:00.799 --> 00:33:09.840
so when it comes to having a sales page
remember it's not all about marketing

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:15.440
it's also about structure you know you
want to start with that statement that

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:21.519
make people say that's me then what the
cost is of staying stuck then the

00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:26.080
solution like your offer framed around
transformation

00:33:23.039 --> 00:33:33.039
sprinkle in social proof and simple next
steps and end with urgency. Gimmicks

00:33:29.679 --> 00:33:38.080
typically don't sell. Um, you want to
definitely have a system and a process.

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:43.840
Manually doing everything. Having sticky
notes is not the best way. Find a system

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:49.760
that works for you. Um, you'll
definitely want a CRM, an email

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:53.519
automation, a calendar booking. You
know, depending on your business, you

00:33:51.519 --> 00:34:00.080
might want proposals and contract
templates and even a dashboard. And just

00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:05.919
remember that the systems are there to
free your brain so you're not looking

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:10.240
for things and things aren't following
through the cracks. And that's another

00:34:08.399 --> 00:34:14.800
question people ask is, "How do I make
sure no leads fall through the cracks?"

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:21.040
Um, you need a follow-up cadence that's
automatic. Every lead should be tagged

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:26.720
hot, warm, cold. Each tag has its own
rhythm, daily, weekly, monthly. You

00:34:23.679 --> 00:34:32.079
know, I like to ask people how they like
to communicate, text, phone call, email.

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:41.440
I like to know if somebody is big
picture or details, so I know properly

00:34:36.399 --> 00:34:48.720
what to give them. Um, most people when
it comes to sales, they get their first

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:57.920
no and they stop. They stop right after
that. But the truth is, it takes people

00:34:53.359 --> 00:35:03.520
about seven hours of maintaining content
to be able to make a decision. And it

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:12.800
takes them about seven different
exposures sometimes. And that means

00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:17.680
you want to consistently follow up and
you want to consistently ask for

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:24.720
testimonials and referrals. That's how
you build a big business.

00:35:21.359 --> 00:35:30.800
A lot of people always ask, "What should
I focus on more? Getting more leads or

00:35:27.599 --> 00:35:37.440
improving my close rate?"
And this is the thing. There's no point

00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:42.000
getting more leads if you can't close
because you never get a second chance to

00:35:39.839 --> 00:35:47.119
make a first impression. So, if you
can't close qualified people, then it

00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:51.680
doesn't matter how many leads that
you're getting. So, if you could double

00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:59.359
the conversion before you doubled
traffic, then you just scaled profit

00:35:55.200 --> 00:36:04.000
without spending more money. So, another
thing people always ask is, "How do I

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:10.720
turn
one-time clients into long-term ones?"

00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:16.640
And it's really simple. It's communicate
and invite them and to have something

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:22.560
else for them. So, show them the results
and then ask, "How do you keep momentum

00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:27.760
going?" Share what you think the next
step should be. Like, keep building next

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:34.640
step, next step, next step. and always
know what the next step is. And this

00:36:31.839 --> 00:36:41.520
will enable you to scale
much quicker when you have different

00:36:37.359 --> 00:36:46.640
options for people. And um you can turn
that framework, you can turn checklists,

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:51.599
templates, you know, anything that you
want, you can

00:36:49.599 --> 00:36:58.240
continue to get in front of clients
with. It's you. It's always having that

00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:58.240
personal touch.

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:11.119
So, a lot of all of sales is mindset.
It's really about the state you're in.

00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:15.520
How you feel, how you stop feeling
awkward about your offer is you got to

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:20.560
stop making it about you. It's not your
offer. It's their outcome. You're not

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:25.839
asking for money. You're showing someone
how to solve their problem. If you

00:37:23.359 --> 00:37:31.599
believe that and you believe in your
services and products, then there won't

00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:37.200
be any awkwardness, you know, and and
that's the same for staying confident

00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:42.400
when people say no. Detach from it. You
know, confidence is built in process,

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:47.359
not an outcome. If you've asked the
right questions, offered real valued,

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:54.880
and follow up, that's the win. Rejection
is just feedback and it's important to

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:59.119
get so you know what to tweak or what to
do to move forward.

00:37:57.200 --> 00:38:03.920
Um, a lot of people worry that they're
going to get burnt out in sales. You

00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:09.920
know, this is boundaries is key. Set
specific hours for sale. You know, um,

00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:13.040
that's what I like to do. And again, you
know, when you're not burnt out when

00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:17.440
you're selling stuff. There's not a
salesperson who wouldn't keep selling if

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:22.800
they were on a roll. And so, really
think about your whole mindset. And

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:28.000
again, mindset isn't learned in a day.
It's not learned in um an hour. Mindset

00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:32.040
is something that's going to be an
ongoing thing.
